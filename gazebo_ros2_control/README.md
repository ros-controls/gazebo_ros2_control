# Gazebo ros_control Interfaces

This is a ROS 2 package for integrating the [ros2_control](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control) controller architecture
with the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator.

This package provides a Gazebo plugin which instantiates a ros_control
controller manager and connects it to a Gazebo model.
